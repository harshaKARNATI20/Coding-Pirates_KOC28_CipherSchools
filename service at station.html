         <h3><p>1. Services at station</p></h3>
        <br>Stations usually have staffed ticket sales offices, automated ticket machines, or both, although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains.
 Many stations include a shop or convenience store. Larger stations usually have fast-food or restaurant facilities. In some countries, stations may also have a bar or pub.
 Other station facilities may include: toilets, left-luggage, lost-and-found, departures and arrivals boards, luggage carts, waiting rooms, taxi ranks, bus bays and even car parks.
 Larger or staffed stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office. These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost.
 In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock. A basic station might only have platforms, though it may still be distinguished from a halt, a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms.</br>

        <h3>2. Services at station</h3>
         <br>In addition to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first is the level of the tracks.
 Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a level crossing, the road and railway will be at different levels.
 The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both.
 The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in urban areas,
 except when the station is a terminus. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops,
 causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time. Stations also exist where the station buildings are above the tracks.</p></br><br/><br/><br/><br/>
